## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies by typing in "npm install" in the command line. Intialize the schema and seed the database before running this application.

## Usage

Given a functional Express.js API, when adding database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then you are able to connect to a database using Sequelize. When entering schema and seed commands, a development database is created and seeded with test data. When entering the command to invoke the application, your server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. When opening API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, you are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in your database.
